 # Laundry list (unordered) of items to modify in the text
   for fall 2012

     * coalesce functions and return values; don't treat these
       separately

     * Move some basic string stuff earlier
         * Maybe modify % formatting to use the format method, which is 
           way, way cleaner and less weird syntactically

     * Move some basic list stuff earlier

     * Move recursion a bit later (before second exam; before full
       treatment of lists)

     * Streamline class/object stuff

     * More emphasis on program design
         * divide and conquer
         * piecewise refinement
         * simplify and conquer
         * translate the problem space 

     * testing - assert and test case writing; unit test after classes?

     * remove mention of globals

     * move treatment of advanced topics (pickling, etc.) to an appendix

     * take out subsections that we definitely don't cover

     * Add pointers to resources and additional tools (e.g., python
       tutor) up front

         * Add links to department wiki and OSQA (tbd) installation

     * pointers to things that students shouldn't use (e.g., globals)

     * Add searching, limited sorting chapter(s)               


 # Longer term modifications

     * Change chapter structure to fit more closely the idea of
       chapter-a-week

     * Python 3 modifications
         * print()
         * file io
         * some module differences (e.g., turtle)
         * range() gives an iterator rather than a list
         * type vs class

     * Dump the swampy stuff to be more generically turtle; swampy is
       buggy (chortle), and doesn't really add anything

     * Modify focus to be more problem-driven rather than syntax/tool driven
