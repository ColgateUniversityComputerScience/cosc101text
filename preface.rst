    <h4>Preface</h4>

Welcome to COSC 140!  This textbook is an updated version of "Solving
Problems with Python" used in COSC 101 at Colgate University.  This
version of the text includes two significant changes:

  * Python version 3 is used instead of Python 2, and
  * The chapters and contents have been modified and updated to include
    examples relevant to building web applications.

This book was originally written by A. Downey under the titles "How to
think like a computer scientist", and "Python for software design."
Under terms of the GNU Public License, his text has been remixed and
modified for use at Colgate University.  For the original source text, 
see <http://thinkpython.com>.  

The source text for this book is written in reStructuredText and converted
to pdf, ebook, and HTML using the excellent Sphinx documentation tool
(<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>).  All code and book
source is available under terms of the GNU Public License and hosted
at github.com <https://github.com/ColgateUniversityComputerScience>.
This version of the book can be found in the branch py3kcosc140 on 
github.
