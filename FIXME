 * Need to index keywords, functions, and other concepts using sphinx index-generating markup

 * Add SOFA (short, do one thing, take few arguments, consistent level of abstraction) and code smells (duplicated code, long functions, functions with many arguments, global variables) to text?

 * write extension classes for simple quizzes for html (and epub?) versions
    - at least show question for latex/pdf version
